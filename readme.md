## Tutorials

The tutorials in this repo are as follows:

1. **Getting Started**

    and run some Ansible.  The tutorial is located in the
    [**t1-getting-started**](./t1-getting-started) folder.

2. **Getting Started with Playbooks**

    Adds to tutorial 1 by introducing playbooks.
    The tutorial is located in the

    Adds to tutorial 2 by showing how to work with variables in a playbook.
    The tutorial is located in the
    [**t3-using-variables**](./t3-using-variables) folder.

1. **Organizing Your Ansible Code With Roles**

    As you build for your Ansible project(s), you will recognize a proliferation
    of playbooks and variables, and soon, you will have a hard time recognizing 
    what your ansible code is doing.  To solve this problem, the playbooks
    can be refactored into Ansible roles.  The purpose of this tutorial is to
    show how to refactor your variables and playbooks into an Ansible role.    
    The tutorial is located in the
    [**t4-organizing-your-ansible-code-with-roles**](./t4-organizing-your-ansible-code-with-roles )
    folder.
